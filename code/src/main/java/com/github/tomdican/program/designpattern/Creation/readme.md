1. Creational
These design patterns are all about class instantiation or object creation. These patterns can be further categorized into Class-creational patterns and object-creational patterns. While class-creation patterns use inheritance effectively in the instantiation process, object-creation patterns use delegation effectively to get the job done.

Creational design patterns are Factory Method, Abstract Factory, Builder, Singleton, Object Pool and Prototype.
